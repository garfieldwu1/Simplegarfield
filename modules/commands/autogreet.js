And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.","I can do all this through him who gives me strength.","But those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.","Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is - his good, pleasing and perfect will.","Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.","For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.","For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.","Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.","I can do all this through him who gives me strength.","And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.","But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.","But those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.","The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing.","Do everything in love.","For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.","Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.","Love is like a friendship caught on fire.","The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved.","I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more.","The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.","Love is not about how much you say 'I love you,' but how much you can prove that it's true." ,"Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope.","In your smile, I see something more beautiful than the stars.","Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.","You are my sun, my moon, and all my stars.","Love isn't something you find. Love is something that finds you.","True love stories never have endings.","You are my everything, my sunshine after the rain.","Love is not needing a snooze button on your alarm clock because when it goes off the first time, the thought of your partner makes it impossible to fall back asleep.","I love you for all that you are, all that you have been, and all that you will be.","Love isn't something you find. It's something that finds you.","You are the last thought in my mind before I drift off to sleep and the first thought when I wake up each morning.","I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you.","You are my favorite notification.","Love is the bridge between two hearts.","When I'm with you, hours feel like seconds. When we're apart, days feel like years.","You have no idea how fast my heart races when I see you.","Love me and the world is mine.","I never loved you any more than I do, right this second. And I'll never love you any less than I do, right this second.","Every moment spent with you is like a beautiful dream come true.","You are my paradise, and I would happily get stranded on you for a lifetime.","You make every day feel like Valentine's Day.","My heart is perfect because you are in it.","I can conquer the world with one hand as long as you're holding the other.","You are the reason I look down at my phone and smile.","Every love story is beautiful, but ours is my favorite.","In your arms is where I want to be.","I wish I had done everything on Earth with you.","I'm much more me when I'm with you.","You are my today and all of my tomorrows.","The best and most beautiful things in this world cannot be seen or even heard, but must be felt with the heart.","I love you to the moon and back.","You are the missing piece to my puzzle.","Love is a promise; love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.","You are the reason why I smile. You are the reason why I live.","The best love is the kind that awakens the soul; that makes us reach for more, that plants the fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds.","In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours.

it sweetens everything it touches.","You are the frosting on top of my cake.","Every time I see you, my heart skips a beat.","Your smile is my favorite kind of sweetness.","Love is a journey, and I'm grateful to be on this sweet ride with you.","You are the missing piece to my sweetness puzzle.","Love is the key that unlocks the door to a sweet and fulfilling life.","Your love is like a sweet melody that plays in my heart.","You are the sweetest dream I never want to wake up from.","You make my heart flutter like a butterfly in a field of flowers.","Your love is the sweetest melody that plays in my mind all day long.","You are my sweet escape from reality.","Love is not about finding the perfect person;
